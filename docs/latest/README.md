# The latest documentation

[The latest documentation](http://uportal-project.github.io/uportal-app-framework/) is hosted live on GitHub Pages.

(This page exists because this was historically more complicated -- if you followed a link to get here that link should be updated to drop the `/latest/` from the end of it.)
