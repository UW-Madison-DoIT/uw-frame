# uw-frame documentation

[uw-frame](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DoIT/uw-frame) is a framework for building web applications that look and feel like they belong in an [AngularJS-portal][] portal (such as [MyUW][]). It includes the portal header, settings, footer, and some reusable components,
as well as the configuration options and dependencies you need to get your app up and running quickly.
