# In-app messaging (user-facing content)

This application supports a variety of forms of in-app messaging. We categorize these types of messages under
three broader categories: Notifications, Announcements, and Widget Messaging.

## Notifications

Notifications are messages about **you** (i.e. the user). They're for delivering information that pertain to the user or a group the user belongs to. Notifications are discoverable in the following ways:

#### Notification bell

On medium and large screens, a bell icon button appears in the application's top bar. If the user has unseen notifications, the bell displays a number and shows a preview window when clicked. Clicking the
"See all" link brings users to the notifications page for a more detailed view.

On small screens, a small bell icon without a count appears on top of the mobile menu button.

#### Mobile menu link

In addition to the bell icon, the mobile menu contains a link to the notifications page that also displays the number of unseen notifications.

#### Priority notifications

For critical notifications that require a higher degree of visibility, notifications can be designated as "high priority" and will appear more prominently, fixed above the
application top bar. In cases when the user has more than one priority notification to view, a generic message will be displayed, featuring the priority notifications
count and a link to the notifications page.

#### Nofitications page

On the notifications page, users can view their notifications, dismiss them, and follow calls to action. They can also click the "Dismissed" tab to view notifications they've previously dismissed. High priority notifications
float to the top of the list.

## Announcements

Announcementes are messages about the app or about things that pertain to everyone. They're for telling users about things like new app features.
MyUW [documents how it uses announcements](https://kb.wisc.edu/myuw/page.php?id=63903) in its Knowledge Base.

Announcements are discoverable in two ways: The mascot announcer and popup modals.
See the [technical implementation doc](messaging-implementation.md) to see how to create a mascot image and how to write both types of announcements.

#### Mascot announcer

When enabled and when the user has unseen announcements, a mascot appears in the top bar.

When hovered, the mascot slides up a little and shows a tooltip inviting the user to click to see more. The tooltip also displays the number of unseen announcements to view.

When clicked, it displays a preview window with the latest announcements. Clicking the "See all" link
brings the user to the Features page, where there's a more detailed view of all announcements.

#### Popup modal

Announcements that are designated "high priority" will appear in the mascot announcer's menu, but will also be displayed in the form of a modal upon loading the app. Users can dismiss the modal
by clicking elsewhere on the screen or clicking a configurable "confirm" button.

## Widget messaging

Widget messaging can be used to give the user a message in a way that interrupts
a user's interaction with a widget.  A dialog appears over the widget allowing
the user to continue after reading the message.  An optional `Learn more` button
 is an opportunity to link to a learn more page.
