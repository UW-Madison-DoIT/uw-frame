# Widgets in uportal-app-framework

It's possible for uportal-app-framework apps to pull in the markup and configuration for widgets in the MyUW "marketplace" of apps.

You can experiment with widgets in the [Widget Creator][] (currently available in test tier only).

## Fetching MyUW app widget

If you're a uportal-app-framework developer and you want to include, for example, the Wiscard Balance widget in your app, you can do so by
using the `widget` directive, like so:


```html
<widget fname="wiscard-balance"></widget>
```

You **must** know the app's "`fname`" attribute to use this feature.

If you want to create a new widget to include in your frame app, follow the steps described in the [widget documentation](make-a-widget.md)
and then:
