### How do I use widgets?
While uw-frame does include some CSS rules for widgets, the directives that govern them live in the [angularjs-portal](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DoIT/angularjs-portal)
project, so their use is currently restricted to portal. See portal's [widget expanded mode documentation][] for
information about how to use widgets in that app.

You can experiment with widgets in the [Widget Creator][].

[Let us know](mailto:uw-infra@office365.wisc.edu) if you'd like widgets available in your frame app.
