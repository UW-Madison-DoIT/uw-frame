### How do I use widgets?
While uw-frame does include some CSS rules for widgets, the directives that govern them live in the [angularjs-portal](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DoIT/angularjs-portal) 
project, so their use is currently restricted to portal. See [portal's expanded mode documentation](http://uw-madison-doit.github.io/angularjs-portal/latest/#/md/expanded) for 
information about how to use widgets in that app. 

You can experiment with widgets in our [Widget Creator](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DoIT/myuw-smart-widget-creator).

[Let us know](mailto:uw-infra@office365.wisc.edu) if you'd like widgets available in your frame app.
