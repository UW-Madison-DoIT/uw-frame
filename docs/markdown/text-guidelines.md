### MyUW, My UW-Madison, My UW-System
Bare 'MyUW' never has a space between the letters. However, 'My UW-Madison' and 'My UW-System' are always spaced and dashed as so.
### App Title
30 characters maximum. Avoid the word “your.” When possible, avoid the word “my” unless it’s necessary to differentiate it from another app. (For example, an app with a list of a student’s courses would be titled “My Courses” because a “Courses” app would be a list of all courses at the university.)

Avoid the word "information". (There's little that isn't information.) Example, instead of "Retirement Information" prefer "Retirement" or "Retirement Planning" if emphasizing that the task the app supports is planning for retirement.

### App Description
80 characters maximum. Avoid the word “your.” (For example, instead of “view your earnings and tax statements,” use “view earnings and tax statements.”)
