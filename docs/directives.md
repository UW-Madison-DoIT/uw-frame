# AngularJS directives in uportal-app-framework

## App header

`app-header` directive should be used for all pages in a frame based app. You can either utilize the frame-page directive, or just this directive with custom code.

There is also a directive called `app-header-two-way-bind`. This has all the same features as `app-header` except all the scope attributes are passed in via `=` instead of `@`. This provides 2 way binding for your header. Research angular directives for more details.

### Template :

```html
<app-header
  app-title="Hello World"
  app-icon="email"
  app-fname="hey-world-fname"
  app-show-add-to-home="false"
></app-header>
```

### Params :

All params are prefixed with `app-`.

* **title**: The title that will be displayed in the app header
* **icon**: The icon to use as a prefix to the app title. You can use Font Awesome (i.e. "fa-envelope") or Material Icons (i.e. "email").
* **show-add-to-home**: If set to true, will include the add-to-home directive and its controller in the app header (used for apps that are part of the portal ecosystem).
* **fname**: If provided, it will be used in the add-to-home feature. If not, it'll try to use NAMES.fname constant.

## Frame page

Frame page is basically the app header directive but with a transclude for the body. It **Inherits** all of the app-header directive parameters.

**Example page**: see `/portal/main/partials/example-page.html`

### Template :

```html
<frame-page
  app-title="Hello World"
  app-icon="school"
  app-fname="hey-world-fname"
  app-show-add-to-home="false"
  white-background="true"
>
This part is included via ng-transclude
</frame-page>
```

### Params

_See `app-header`_

### Options

* **white-background**: A boolean when set to true with give you a white background with 98% width, with a 1% `left-margin`.

## Circle button

  data-disabled='false'
  data-title=''>
</circle-button>
```

#### Params:

* **href**: Where you want them to go
* **target**: Open in new window, new tab, or the same tab (i.e. "\_self", "\_blank", etc.). If no target is set, it will default to the same tab.
* **md-icon**: The material icon to use. If a material icon is specific, it will be preferred over any fa-icon specified.
