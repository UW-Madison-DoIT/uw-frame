### Typography style guide
For the time being, defer to the typography specs provided by [Google Material](https://material.google.com/style/typography.html) and
[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/latest/CSS/typography).

### MyUW syntax

#### MyUW vs. My UW-Madison
"MyUW" by itself should never contain spaces. However, "My UW-Madison," "My UW-System," etc. are always spaced and hyphenated as written here.

#### App title
* Your app title (displayed in the app-header directive) should be **30 characters long at most** 
* Avoid the word "your" 
* Avoid the word "my" unless it’s necessary to differentiate it from another app (e.g. an pp with a list of a student’s courses would be titled “My Courses” because a “Courses” app would be a list of all courses at the university)
* Avoid the word "information" (because there is little that isn't information). This word does not provide any helpful context. For example, instead of "Retirement Information," the title should be "Retirement."

#### App Description
* 80 characters max
* Avoid the word “your” (e.g. instead of “view your earnings and tax statements,” use “view earnings and tax statements”)
