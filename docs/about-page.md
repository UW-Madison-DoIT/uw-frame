# Configuring the About page

The "About" page pulls information from a JSON source to tell users about your app. The page supports plain text
and a list of links.

The data in the JSON source is also used to set the app's "description" and "keywords" `<meta>` tags. 

To direct your app to a JSON source, add the URL to your app's "override.js" file under `SERVICE_LOC.aboutPageURL`. For example:

```javascript
.constant('OVERRIDE', {
  'SERVICE_LOC': {
    'aboutPageURL': 'path/to/source.json'      
  }
}
```

## JSON structure
