# Documentation versions

The latest [documentation is live on the web](http://uw-madison-doit.github.io/uw-frame).

To view documentation for a specific version of `uw-frame`

1. Navigate to the desired [release on GitHub](https://github.com/UW-Madison-DoIT/uw-frame/releases) (or check out the desired tag in your local `git` clone).
2. Read the documentation, either by inspecting a local copy of the source code (you can handily download this from the release on GitHub) or by looking at the codebase at that commit (linked from the release on GitHub).

(Try not to need to look at old versions of the documentation. Upgrade to latest instead.)
